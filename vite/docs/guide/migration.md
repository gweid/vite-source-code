# Migration from v3

## Rollup 3

Vite is now using [Rollup 3](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/9870), which allowed us to simplify Vite's internal asset handling and has many improvements. See the [Rollup 3 release notes here](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

Rollup 3 is mostly compatible with Rollup 2. If you are using custom [`rollupOptions`](../config/build-options.md#rollup-options) in your project and encounter issues, refer to the [Rollup migration guide](https://rollupjs.org/migration/) to upgrade your config.

## Modern Browser Baseline change

The modern browser build now targets `safari14` by default for wider ES2020 compatibility (bumped from `safari13`). This means that modern builds can now use [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) and that the [nullish coalescing operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing) isn't transpiled anymore. If you need to support older browsers, you can add [`@vitejs/plugin-legacy`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy) as usual.

## General Changes

### Encoding

The build default charset is now utf8 (see [#10753](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/10753) for details).

### Importing CSS as a String

In Vite 3, importing the default export of a `.css` file could introduce a double loading of CSS.

```ts
import cssString from './global.css'
```

This double loading could occur since a `.css` file will be emitted and it's likely that the CSS string will also be used by the application code â€” for example, injected by the framework runtime. From Vite 4, the `.css` default export [has been deprecated](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/11094). The `?inline` query suffix modifier needs to be used in this case, as that doesn't emit the imported `.css` styles.

```ts
import stuff from './global.css?inline'
```

### Production Builds by Default

`vite build` will now always build for production regardless of the `--mode` passed. Previously, changing `mode` to other than `production` would result in a development build. If you wish to still build for development, you can set `NODE_ENV=development` in the `.env.{mode}` file.

In part of this change, `vite dev` and `vite build` will not override `process.env.NODE_ENV` anymore if it is already defined. So if you've set `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development'` before building, it will also build for development. This gives more control when running multiple builds or dev servers in parallel.

See the updated [`mode` documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#modes) for more details.

### Environment Variables

Vite now uses `dotenv` 16 and `dotenv-expand` 9 (previously `dotenv` 14 and `dotenv-expand` 5). If you have a value including `#` or `` ` ``, you will need to wrap them with quotes.

```diff
-VITE_APP=ab#cd`ef
+VITE_APP="ab#cd`ef"
```

For more details, see the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [`dotenv-expand` changelog](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Advanced

There are some changes which only affect plugin/tool creators.

- [[#11036] feat(client)!: remove never implemented hot.decline](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/11036)
  - use `hot.invalidate` instead
- [[#9669] feat: align object interface for `transformIndexHtml` hook](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/9669)
  - use `order` instead of `enforce`

Also there are other breaking changes which only affect few users.

- [[#11101] feat(ssr)!: remove dedupe and mode support for CJS](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/11101)
  - You should migrate to the default ESM mode for SSR, CJS SSR support may be removed in the next Vite major.
- [[#10475] feat: handle static assets in case-sensitive manner](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/10475)
  - Your project shouldn't rely on an OS ignoring file names casing.
- [[#10996] fix!: make `NODE_ENV` more predictable](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/10996)
  - Refer to the PR for an explanation about this change.
